# Daccy - Elevate Your DSA Skills with AI ðŸ’»âœ¨

**Learn, Debug, and Succeed** with AI-powered assistance.

Daccy is an AI-powered learning web application designed to help users master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through real-time debugging support, personalized learning paths, and AI-generated challenges.

## Features

- **AI-Based DSA Challenges**: Problems generated based on user-selected difficulty levels with intentional bugs for learning.
- **AI Chatbot**: Get answers to DSA-related questions using Gemini AI.
- **Generative Learning**: Automatically generated content on DSA topics like arrays, linked lists, and more.

## Challenges

We faced inconsistencies with the Gemini AI model's content generation. To overcome this:
- **Refined input prompts** for more accurate results.
- Implemented **quality control** by reviewing AI-generated content.
- Added a **user feedback system** for continuous improvement.
